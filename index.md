```python
def welcome():
  return "hi mom"
```

## My Philosophy of Software Development
- I strive to write clean, consistent, maintainable code with no suprises.
- I design for scale, avoid nested loops and database calls, and cache all the things.
- I keep code [SOLID](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#solid) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- I strive to minimize cognitive load during context switching by using intuitive variable names and clear comments.
- I have a dual background in technical writing; I actually enjoy crafting well-written documentation.
- I take code reviews seriously.
- I check my ego at the door.
- I love my work.

I like OSX in dark mode, [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), a modified [Glowfish theme](https://github.com/czettnersandor/st3-glowfish-theme) for that nice vintage green-on-black, and [Source Code Pro Extra Light](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) for a font that's easy on the eyes.

I love the feeling of closing browser tabs _en masse_ when I've wrapped up a project.


## Cool Stuff I've Done

- [Proteus Digital Health](https://www.proteus.com/). Architected and implemented a highly-configurable rules engine from scratch. Consumes a patient's data in real time and calculates their triage score, so that doctors can rapidly identify priority patients.
- [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/). Built GoPro's developer documentation platform and wrote 80+ pages of API reference and quickstart tutorial content.
- [Space Systems Loral](http://sslmda.com/). Wrote electrical assembly and test procedures for 18 commercial communication satellites, currently in orbit.


## Industry Experience

I have experience in these spaces:

- Event-driven, serverless architecture.
- Internal tooling.
- IoT prescription drugs.
- FDA regulatory compliance.
- HIPAA compliance.
- Medical device, aerospace, pharmaceutical industries.
