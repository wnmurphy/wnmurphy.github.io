## Professional Highlights

### @ [Proteus Digital Health](https://www.proteus.com/)

Architected and implemented a highly-configurable rules engine from the ground up. Consumes a patient's data in real time and calculates their triage score, so that doctors can rapidly identify priority patients. Written in node.js on AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, API Gateway. Wrote test suite with Mocha and Chai to achieve complete unit test coverage.

Owned, developed, maintained, and provided troubleshooting and support for mock data generation tool used by all product teams. Written in Python 3. Used Behave to convert BDD statements to cloud API calls with templated request bodies. Used by developers to develop new product features by generating simulated user resources and metric data in Cloud. Created unit test suite and integrated into build to prevent regression bugs. Converted tool into importable package, so it could be used directly in other teams' test suites.

Built a test suite for our manufacturing facility in Hayward.

Overhauled our user configuration logic. Created new API endpoints, DynamoDB tables and a lambda to handle API requests and validation. Wrote database backfill functions to migrate old data structures to new ones in production. Implemented caching on lambda initialization to drop global resource lookup time from 1500ms to 500ms.

Implemented Python command-line tools for listening to DynamoDB stream for debugging and uploading files to S3 from local machine using Boto3 SDK.

Wrote a set of tools for patient data migration/archiving, allowing us to preserve protected data while freeing up an environment.

### @ [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/)

Built GoPro's developer documentation platform and wrote 80+ pages of API reference and quickstart tutorial content with sample code.

### @ [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/)

Studied my tail off to get into a grueling software engineering program which had a 3% acceptance rate at that time. Built a location-sharing app called IRL (React.js, Socket.io). Built a collaborative project management app called Cliqueboard (AngularJS, express.js).

### @ [Space Systems Loral](http://sslmda.com/)

Wrote electrical assembly and test procedures for 18 commercial communication satellites, currently in orbit.

### @ Personal

Wrote the stock trading tool for volume spread analysis that I always wished I had.
