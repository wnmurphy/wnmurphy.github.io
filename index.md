Welcome. I write the codes real good.

```python
def welcome():
  return "hire me"
```

## Particularly Cool Stuff I've Done

- [Proteus Digital Health](https://www.proteus.com/). Architected and implemented a highly-configurable rules engine from scratch. Consumes a patient's data in real time and calculates their triage score, so that doctors can rapidly identify priority patients.
- [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/). Built GoPro's developer documentation platform and wrote 80+ pages of API reference and quickstart tutorial content.
- [Space Systems Loral](http://sslmda.com/). Wrote electrical assembly and test procedures for 18 commercial communication satellites, currently in orbit.


## Industry Experience
