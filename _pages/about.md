# About Me

Hi. I'm Neil. I'm a senior software engineer with emphasis in backend tech and cloud infrastructure.

## My Philosophy of Software Development
- I strive to write clean, consistent, maintainable code with no suprises.
  - I design for scale, avoid nested iteration and extraneous database calls, and cache all the things.
  - I keep code [SOLID](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#solid) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
  - I take code quality seriously and dedicate time to code reviews.
- I strive to make life easy for whoever touches the code after me:
  - I care about minimizing the cognitive load of context switching. 
  - I use intuitive variable names and write clear, useful comments.
  - I take documentation seriously. 
- I value a non-toxic workplace and always check my ego at the door.
- I love my work.


## Bonus Skills

I have additional backgrounds in:
- technical writing. I actually enjoy crafting well-written documentation.
- training. I enjoy explaining concepts and teaching others.
- customer success. I enjoy helping other people achieve their technical goals.

## Miscellaneous

I like OSX in dark mode, [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), a modified [Glowfish theme](https://github.com/czettnersandor/st3-glowfish-theme) for that nice vintage green-on-black, and [Source Code Pro Extra Light](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) for a font that's easy on the eyes.

I love the feeling of closing browser tabs _en masse_ after a PR is merged.
