# About Me

Hi. I'm Neil. I'm a senior software engineer with 3+ years of experience; I started full stack, but now specialize in backend tech and cloud infrastructure. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

## My Philosophy of Software Development

### I strive to write clean, consistent, maintainable code with no suprises.

I'm mindful of best practices, like keeping code [SOLID](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#solid) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). I design for scale, avoid nested iteration and extraneous database calls, and cache all the things. I care about code quality, and set aside dedicated time for code reviews.

### I strive to make life easy for whoever touches the code after me.

I care about minimizing the cognitive load of context switching. Given the choice to write clever code or legible code, legible wins every time. I use intuitive variable names and write clear, useful comments. I take documentation seriously. 

### I strive to add value to my team.

I care about creating a non-toxic workplace and always check my ego at the door. I like to help others be successful, and am happy to spend time answering questions for stakeholders and other developers.

I love my work.


## Bonus Skills

I have additional backgrounds in:
- technical writing. I actually enjoy crafting well-written documentation and understand how to convey technical concepts.
- training. I enjoy explaining concepts and teaching others.
- customer success. I enjoy helping other people achieve their technical goals.

## Miscellaneous

I like OSX in dark mode, [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), a modified [Glowfish theme](https://github.com/czettnersandor/st3-glowfish-theme) for that nice vintage green-on-black, and [Source Code Pro Extra Light](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) for a font that's easy on the eyes.

I love the feeling of closing browser tabs _en masse_ after a PR is merged.

I can't bring myself to watch HBO's _Silicon Valley_, because it's way too real.
